👋 Hi, I’m @0kakarot0, a software engineer with a passion for automation testing.

👀 I’m interested in keeping up with the latest technologies related to automation testing, including machine learning and AI-driven testing.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Selenium WebDriver with Java and exploring new testing frameworks like TestNG and Appium.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java-based automation projects using Selenium, Appium, and TestNG.

📫 Reach out to me on LinkedIn at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahtisham-ilyas-62193768/) to connect and discuss potential collaboration opportunities. Let's build high-quality software together!
